# HTML5-Calculator-IN-PROGRESS-

# WELCOME! to a harder-than-it-needs-to-be calculator project

#### so this time im gonna be learning how to use CSS grids! but im gonna be at school doing this, so gonna have to hide it.

#### apart from writing this now and then looking back and thinking its cringe, 3/3/24 project is setup for cloning tomorrow to my chromebook to code.

#### Things and apps and code and whatnot: https://gsap.com, https://code.visualstudio.com, and https://github.com/Axhllexo

#### going back and editing this readme reminds me of obsidian and the hashtag things for headers, maybe i should go back instead of using notion

#### 3/4/24: did the grid! easier than i though and i put together a basic button thing (super unorganized and broken). will work on fixes tommorow and improvements.
